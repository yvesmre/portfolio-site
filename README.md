# Portfolio Website built using Gatsby with TypeScript and Tailwind

This is the codebase for my personal website.


## How it works
The website automatically generates project and portfolio pages as specified in the two json files named 'portfolio' and 'projects'

Portfolio Work

* Defined by a title, slug, splash, description and thumbnail
* Any images in the folder data/portfolio/{slug} will be used to populate the website


## TODO

* Drop deprecated Gatsby Image Sharp in webpages
